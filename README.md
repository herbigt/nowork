no work

I recently wondered, how many days I probably don't actually work. You could maybe do something with tags in day one or so, but I thought it would be fun to have a little app, where you could just hit "+" after a day without of work.

The app should then always keep this counter and show you, when you startet using the app. It shoud then also give you the opportunity to share your current amount of days.
No work is at first an app I want to use, but I'll probably also put in for free in the App Store, if it reaches a state, where it at least does some basic functionality I have in mind.
